# Ascendancy Seasonal Campaign System

A digitized version of my personal objective tracking and planning system. I find that the system works best when written and management manually with pen to paper but creating a digital variant for data tracking, remote access, or for people who prefer it is a good way for me to grind rust off of skills while learning some new ones.

## Objective

Develop a fullstack CRUD app, using minimal AI, that fills a gap in my personal planning system, so that I can add to, improve, and demonstrate my skills.

## Intended Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostreSQL via SQLModel
- **Frontend Web:** React + Vite
- **Frontend Mobile:** React-Native
- **NeoVim Plugin:** Lua
- **TUI**: Rust
- **DevOps** Nix, devenv, Github actions, Caddy

## Requirements
- [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) - See [getting started](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) for installation.

## Dev Workflow

Dependencies are primarily managed devenv in `devenv.nix` where you can add `pip` packages, and other tools as needed.

Run `devenv up` to start processes and services.

## Issue Tracking and TODOs

This repository tracks and prioritizes issues using GitHub Projects
https://github.com/users/EmergentMind/projects/1

As a general rule, TODOs and FIXMEs should be addressed prior to PR or converted to Issues for prioritization. 

Using Projects is for practice and demonstration instead of personal preference.
